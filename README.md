In this project, i have used some sensors to look towards the temperature, humidity, pressure and also added the rain sensor.we learned how to make a weather monitoring system with an ESP32 board. 
For that, I have used the LDR sensor, DHT11 sensor, Rain sensor, and BMP-180 sensor. Therefore, we can get the Temperature, Humidity, Pressure, Light, and Rainfall values.
