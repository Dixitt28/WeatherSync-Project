Designed and implemented a weather monitoring system that integrates real-time dashboarding via an ESP32 board. 
This board has been incorporated with different sensors, which include DHT11 to read temperature and humidity values, BMP-180 to detect atmospheric pressure,
LDR for the intensity of light, and a rain sensor for rainfall detection. Blynk app supports display of sensor data.
